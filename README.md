Based off of Jo Franchetti's [grid-cats.glitch.me](https://grid-cats.glitch.me) via her Medium article [Common Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid and Some Without](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/common-responsive-layouts-with-css-grid-and-some-without-245a862f48df). Transferred into Sass with accessible landmarks and headers by [Kathy Zadrozny](https://github.com/kzadrozny)

## Features
* Fixed/sticky navigation bar
* One page website
* Accessible layout (Using proper headers and landmark roles)
* Sass stylesheet
* Media query based off `em` for more consistent viewport breakpoint behavior
* Gulp tasks that concats Sass, watches files for changes, and reloads local host.
